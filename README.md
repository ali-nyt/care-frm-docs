## Welcome to the Care FRM Guidebook

This guidebook serves as an ongoing reference for issues and common/recurring tasks performed by the Care FRM (aka on-call engineer).

Some issues will have more context than others, some have linked documentation and instructions. This site is powered and hosted by GitHub pages and is maintained by the NYT Care Engineers.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ali-nyt/care-frm-docs/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages from the content in the Markdown files.
